# Research Associated Professor

I am currently a Research Associated Professor in the College of Engineering at the Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo. 
My research focuses on fluid mechanics and data-driven computer-aided engineering, areas in which I strive to advance both theoretical understanding and practical applications.

For more detailed information about my ongoing projects, please visit the [projects]{https://www.ywbin.com/projects/} page. 
A comprehensive record of my publications can be found on the [publications]{https://www.ywbin.com/publications/} page, and my work is also listed on my [google scholar]{https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=czzz4XgAAAAJ&hl=en} profile.

## Education

* 2022 - 2024, **Visiting scholar**, Department of Mechanical Engineering, **The Pennsylvania State University**.
* 2019 - 2024, **Doctor of Philosophy** in Mechanics, **Peking University**.
* 2017 - 2017, **Exchange student**, Department of Energy and Power Engineering, **National Tsinghua University**.

## Professional Career

After completing my bachelor's degree, I pursued a Ph.D. in Mechanics at Peking University, where I delved into the tubulence simulation. 
My time as a visiting scholar at The Pennsylvania State University allowed me to collaborate with Prof. Xiang Yang, further enhancing my research capabilities. 
Currently, at the Eastern Institute of Technology, Ningbo, I am developing innovative AI-driven Computer-Aided Engineering (AI-CAE) solutions.
These solutions aim to revolutionize industrial simulation by integrating artificial intelligence with traditional engineering simulation processes, potentially marking the next generation in this field. 
My work focuses on leveraging machine learning algorithms to enhance simulation accuracy and efficiency, thereby supporting sustainable and optimized engineering practices.
